# Prime Number Image Generator

Generates a prime number from an image. Based on [a fantastic writeup by John May](https://www.mapleprimes.com/maplesoftblog/208543-Is-This-The-Most-Maple-Prime-Post-Ever).

I got completely sidetracked by a post on John's BlueSky profile and had no clue how in the world he had generated this number. He very kindly linked me to his writeup.

Mostly I am responsible for the care and feeding of the algorithms but they also make me muck out the cages. I should post more about math. Here&#x27;s the Maple logo, but it&#x27;s a ~20k digit prime number:<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xotaib3nq6ndclbmy7i5nl3i/post/3lbfpbxzbrc23?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; John May (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xotaib3nq6ndclbmy7i5nl3i?ref_src=embed">@3j0hn.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xotaib3nq6ndclbmy7i5nl3i/post/3lbfpbxzbrc23?ref_src=embed">November 20, 2024 at 2:52 PM</a></blockquote>

The program takes in any png and finds a prime number where every pixel is represented by a digit of that prime number where 1s are while pixels. The project files contain a sample image and example.
